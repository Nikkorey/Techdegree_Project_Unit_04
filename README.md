# Build a Web Style Guide

# Techdegree_Project_Unit 04

## **Description**

For this project I was responsible for creating a sass project, using partials, variables, extends, and mixins to apply the styles to rules for mockups of mobile and desktop layouts using the provided index.html file with a set of class names already defined. I styled the web page using each of those class names. This project provided me with a set of classes that I can use in other projects to apply similar styles. The outcome of this project has given me a Sass micro-framework that I can use to quickly prototype other websites.

I also went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to:

* Create a Flexbox mixin to apply to all Flexbox properties used in the project.
* Create a media query mixin to apply to all the media queries used in the project.

Browsers tested for compatibility:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Edge
* Safari

Grade: Exceeds Expectations
